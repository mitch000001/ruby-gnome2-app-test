This is a MVC ruby-gnome2 application skeleton.  

Prerequisites:

ruby-gnome2 from http://ruby-gnome2.sourceforge.jp/
gems:
  log4r
  ruby-prof
  launchy

Currently controllers/database.rb is setup for using DataMapper so these gems are required:
  dm-core
  dm-more

database.rb is just an example so you can easily replace it with your favorite backend.


Basic steps to get started:

1) copy the lib directory
2) edit lib/my-app.rb to tailor it for your application.
3) rename lib/my-app.rb to your app's name. 
4) have fun
